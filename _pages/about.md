I am a PhD student in Deep Learning at CNAM in the <a href="https://cedric2-demo.cnam.fr/equipes/vertigo/">Vertigo Team</a> advised by <a href="https://cedric.cnam.fr/~thomen/">Prof. Nicolas Thome</a> and  <a href="https://cedric.cnam.fr/~rambourc/">Clément Rambour</a>. 

[comment]: <> ( <a href="https://chcorbi.github.io/">Charles Corbiere</a>)
I am a graduate in Applied Mathematics and Computer Science from Sorbonne University (courses from M2 <a href="https://dac.lip6.fr/master/enseignement/master-2/">DAC</a> and <a href="https://m2a.lip6.fr/">M2A</a>) and Telecom SudParis (<a href="https://vap.telecom-sudparis.eu/msa/">MSA</a>).

I am currently working on Robust and Reliable Uncertainty Estimation for Deep Classifiers with Dirichlet Networks. I have a broad interest in generative models, reinforcement learning, generalization property of deep neural networks and more.

I have previously worked as machine learning consultant at <a href="https://www.quinten.ai/">Quinten</a>.
