I am a PhD student in Deep Learning at Le Cnam in the <a href="https://cedric2-demo.cnam.fr/equipes/vertigo/">Machine Learning team</a>  advised by <a href="https://thome.isir.upmc.fr/">Prof. Nicolas Thome</a> and  <a href="https://cedric.cnam.fr/~rambourc/">Clément Rambour</a>. The focus of my PhD is on the efficient adaptation of deep learning foundation models with a particular interest in improving their robustness. Lately, I have focused on improving the trade-off between accuracy and robustness for few-shot learning methods, e.g. prompt learning, of vision-language foundation models like CLIP.
